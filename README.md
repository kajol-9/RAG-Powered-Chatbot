# RAG-Powered-Chatbot

Build an intelligent, document-aware chatbot using **LangChain** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. This project enables large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate, context-rich responses based on your own documents—going beyond what the model learned during training.

## 📌 Overview

This project is part of a hands-on course exploring:

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to enhance LLM responses with external data
- **Custom chatbot development** powered by LangChain that answers user queries based on private or domain-specific documents



---

## 🔧 Key Components

### 📄 Document Loading
Load data from 80+ formats and sources including:
- PDFs, TXT, CSV, DOCX
- Web pages, Notion, Slack
- Audio/Video transcripts

> Uses LangChain’s rich set of document loaders.

---

### ✂️ Document Splitting
Split documents into optimal chunks to improve:
- Embedding performance
- Retrieval accuracy
- Model context window usage

> Applies best practices for chunk size, overlap, and structure.

---

### 📐 Embeddings & Vector Stores
- Generate dense vector representations using LLM-compatible embedding models
- Store embeddings in vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, Pinecone)

> Enables fast, semantic search across your document set.

---

### 🔍 Retrieval Layer
- Index and search documents using vector similarity
- Retrieve the most relevant chunks in response to user queries

> Powers accurate and contextual question answering.

---

### ❓ Question Answering
- One-pass QA pipeline
- Retrieve → Format → Prompt → Respond

> Ensures minimal latency and optimal performance.

---

### 💬 Conversational Chatbot
- Track and incorporate chat history
- Reference retrieved data alongside user inputs

> Delivers coherent, multi-turn conversation grounded in your data.
